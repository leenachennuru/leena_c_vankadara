### Equality of opportunity
I deeply care about issues concerning equal access to opportunities and I constantly try to engage in discussions and initiatives aimed at addressing them. I am a part of an amazing group of female researchers who are committed to improving the representation of women in STEM research. You can read more about this initiative [here](https://www.wisr.in/).

### Climate change
I am actively looking for projects aimed at alleviating the problem of Climate change through Machine learning tools. If you are interested in this, take a look at the recent workshop [Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning](https://www.climatechange.ai/NeurIPS2019_workshop.html) at NeurIPS 2019.
