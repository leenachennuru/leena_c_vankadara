  The core of my work constitutes making progress towards understanding the fundamental limits of learning problems - answering questions such as when is learning possible and when is it not - and characterizing the interplay between statistical and computational properties of various learning algorithms. In addition, I explore tangential areas of interest such as understanding the generalization properties of algorithms. Please see my [projects](https://leenacvankadara.com/projects "My projects") for a detailed overview of all my current projects.

During the period of this internship, I investigated the theoretical properties of embeddings by answering the question, “What is the best possible sigma distortion and dimension that can be achieved by embedding arbitrary metric spaces (or doubling spaces) into Euclidian space (or more generally, $l_{p}$ spaces)”. In addition, I conducted an empirical analysis to answer the question, “Does sigma-distortion, unlike some of the other distortion measures, carry any predictive power as to whether an embedding is likely to achieve good generalization error in various machine learning tasks”. This work was published in NeurIPS 2019 titled "Measures of distortion for Machine learning".

  This project was a collaborative initiative between the Center for Manuscripts Analysis and the Cognitive Systems group. It involved creating a web-based, interactive image processing tool from scratch to aid in the analysis of Manuscripts for tasks such as writer identification, style transfer, and user-assisted document segmentation. In addition to creating an interactive, touch-enabled, front end tool for handling manuscripts, several computer vision algorithms were implemented on a C++ based server to achieve real-time performance. This allowed users to easily create custom pipelines and quickly run experiments for the aforementioned tasks.
