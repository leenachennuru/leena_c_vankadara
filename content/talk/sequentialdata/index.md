title: Modeling and Learning for Sequential data
event: Seminar for the course - Intelligent Robotics


summary:
abstract: "Statistical learning methods for sequential data are different from traditional machine learning algorithms since the i.i.d assumption is not valid for sequential data. These algorithms need memory and the ability to represent distributions over sequential spaces. In this paper we discuss two different approaches to represent sequential data, Markovian models and Recurrent Neural networks. We discuss the theoretical limitations of each representation and a few extensions/solutions are discussed to mitigate the limitations."
