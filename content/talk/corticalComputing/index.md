title: Invariant Object Recognition
event: Seminar for the course - Bio-inspired Artificial Intelligence.


summary:
abstract: "In this paper, we present a bird's eye view of biologically inspired models of visual recognition. The focus of this paper is to identify some components that constitute a class of biologically inspired visual recognition systems which include convolutional neural networks and HMAX like architectures and to identify the optimality of parameters for each of the components and answer some questions that would lead to construction of what we refer to as the optimal biologically inspired hierarchical architecture for object recognition."
