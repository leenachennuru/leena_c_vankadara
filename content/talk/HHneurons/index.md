title: Dynamics of a network of Hodgkin Huxley neurons under a constant external current.
event: Seminar for the course - Bio-inspired Artificial Intelligence.


summary: ""
abstract: "In this project we have studied single neurons, two coupled neurons, a network of neurons connected in a ring, and a network of neurons with all neurons connected to each other. We have modelled the neurons using the Hodgkin Huxley equations and taken neurons to be coupled electrically with the coupling strength being inversely proportional to the resistance of the synapse. In our simulations, we have studied the dynamics of the neurons in response to an external current fed into one of them. We find that for low values of current, none of the neurons spike. We have also carried out a linear stability analysis to investigate the corresponding fixed point stability. For higher values of currents and for high coupling strength, all neurons show spiking behaviour which vanishes quite suddenly beyond some value of current with the neurons settling down to a low amplitude limit cycle. The value of external current at which this transition takes place reduced with decrease in coupling strength. However, for smaller coupling strength the amplitude of spikes reduce gradually with increasing current. Additionally, we mathematically formulated a dynamical system which exhibits the same sudden transition behaviour from a ghost limit cycle to the limit cycle as exhibited by the network of neurons in order to better understand the dynamics."
